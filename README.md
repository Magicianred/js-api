# News Summary challenge

## Challenge

You'll create an app that summarises the news.

## Project overview

Your app will grab all the headlines from the NewsAPI and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline will show a summary of the article.

### Technologies

You'll write a single page web app.  You'll write your code in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  You won't use Ruby or backend JavaScript.

### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  You'll send requests and get data from the News API to display text.

> The API is hosted on an external server that you don't have to worry about.  You only need a static web server.  That's why this type of architecture is called "serverless".

## User Stories

Some of these stories will need decomposing if they seem too large.
